Some off line projects or personal teaching materials to share to those who is keen to learn regarding programming, AI and robots.
For the last 10 years, I have completed dozens of different interesting projects local and international, using deep learning and AI for hundreds of clients. I can also design and build robots of various kinds as my hobby and I am willing to teach who wants to learn.
